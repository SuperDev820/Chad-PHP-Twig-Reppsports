                "answer": "Broken Arrow is one of the strongest, most fully stacked products on the market today. With over 14+ grams of active ingredients we pack as much clinically dosed, high octane, pump inducing components as possible. On top of this our flavors are, bar none, the best in the game."

                "question": "‚ÄãIs this pre-workout too strong for me?",
                "answer": "We always suggest starting with a half dose, just to be safe. Due to the engulfing energy contained within a single serving, Broken Arrow‚Ñ¢ is only recommended for advanced stimulant users. Under no circumstances should more than 1 serving be consumed in any 24-hour period- and that means no heaping scoops either, we don‚Äôt care how tough you think you are. Don‚Äôt say we didn‚Äôt warn you."
